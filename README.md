# p5js-fireworks
A simple firework simulation inspired by TheCodingTrain.

This is a simple, yet interesting simulation of fireworks, I created it using the p5js Javascript library, I learned a few concepts doing this, and I am very proud of the result. I've just placed it here so I can keep it safe from corruption and perhaps someone would see this and appreciate it ;)

Here is a screenshot:
